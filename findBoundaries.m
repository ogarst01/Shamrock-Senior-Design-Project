inputs: 
image - preprocessed binary image, shadows marked as black pixels
plotOutput - bool, if true make a plot where the boundary of the object is
             shown in red

outputs: 
boundaryPixels - matrix holding indices of pixels that are shadow
                 boundaries

purpose:
Find all the pixels that are part of the boundary of a shadow and display
them on the image.
