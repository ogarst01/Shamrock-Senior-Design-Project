inputs: 
image - preprocessed binary image, shadows marked as black pixels
threshold - threshold value for shadow size to retain (pixels)
plotBoundaries - if true, plot image with boundaries of shadows traced in 
                 red (bool)
outputs: 
shadowImage - image with shadows below the threshold size removed
purpose: Remove small/insignificant shadows in an image by computing shadow
         size with Connected Component Labeling, applying a threshold, and
         removing the shadows below the threshold size.

questions/future improvements:
-what is the best value to use for threshold?
-possibly remove the connectivity matrix and just count the number of
pixels?
